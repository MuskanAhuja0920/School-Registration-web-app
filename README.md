# School-registration-web-app
A web application for applying into a school 
A)	“School  Registration/Admission Form System”  is an application developed for maintaining the records of the student who are going through the online registration process for registering in a school. 
Here the parents /the children register themselves to the application and fill in the application form for whichever class they want to followed by uploading their images and completing the payment online, everything in the app is linked to a single email address that the user enters at the time of registration, we are also providing with a 24hr help service. 
Apart from this we also have an admin panel, which the school will have access to, from there the school can download  the database which contains the information filled by the students in the registration form, they can also download the database which contains the username of people who have completed their payments and they also have access to update student information in the database from the app itself, if requested. 
Thus making it easier for the admin to manage all the information from a single login and also the users can do everything from filling out the form to its payment online.
I also have added important features like forgot password, show password, email verifications, receieving emails whenever required.
signup.php is the first page of the web app
You will need to add in your email address and password in config.php and next.php section(this email is required to send in the necessary emails to the users thus its security should be changed)
You need to download composer on your system to mke this work.
You will also need to update your payment information in the config file inside paytmkit>library
After all these changes and uploading the db to xampp your application will be good to go.
